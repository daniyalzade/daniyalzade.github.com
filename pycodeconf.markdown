## <div id="topics"/>Topics

#### PyPy
* In python implementation of the python interpreter
* Faster than cpython on many benchmarks
* Though, limited support for a lot of c-based libraries
* Main speed benefits come from JIT (Just in time optimization) support
* Considering getting rid of the GIL (global interpreter lock), though as of current version there is still a GIL.

#### JIT Generator
#### Software Transactional Memory
* Possibly pypy's method of achieving lock-free concurrency

#### Coroutines:
* [Interesting Link](http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/Coroutines.pdf)

## <div name="tools"/>Tools
#### virtualenv (python command line utility)
* A way of managing multiple environments at once.
* Especially handy if the different projects you are working on have different library requirements. 
* Works by creating an environment folder for you, and seeting the path to use that folder that has all libraries, etc.

#### zeromq
* A light-weight inner-thread (or process) communication within same/different process on same/different boxes.

#### itty
* itty bitty web framework. (similar to flask)
* easy way of getting a process to respond to HTTP requests

#### Grove
* Hosted easy-to-use IRC for companies. Similar to campfire
* Makes it easy to create groups on the fly (which is burdensome with gchat)

#### Software Transactional Memory
* Way of making concurrency possible without using locking (?)
* Will possibly be used by pypy to remove the GIL in the future

#### pip
* Next generation python package management (easy_install 2.0). Enables installing with source-code, upgrades, removes (which easy_install does not allow)

> pip install --use-mirrors

#### legit
* Github mac client - command line abstraction on main git commands

#### sphinx
* [url] (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/)
* Code documentation markup. Sphinx parser parses this and generates documentaation in HTML/Latex etc.
* There is 

#### bup
* python based filesystem backup tool using github

#### sshuttle
* poormans VPN

## <div id="speakers"/>Speakers
#### Jesse Noller (Embrace the GIL)
* GIL = Global Interpreter Lock
* GIL is required since the python interpreter is not threadsafe (e.g. reference counting, memory management). This means that no 2 threads could be running at the same time. This limits python to use a single-core at a time.
* GIL is released before IO bound operations.

* Dis module in python

> import dis  
> dis.dis(methodname)  

This would show the bytecode representation of the given method name

* A takeaway is not to run python code in tight-loops, i.e. do not iterate over the same set of instructions very high number of times, since instruction interpretation is very expensive.

#### Raymond Hettinger (what makes python awesome)
* Generators/yield - A way of calling sub-routines back/forth without, and be able to return to a sub-routine where it left off, with full stack-state
s
* with statement - A co-routine that gets exectued before and after the execution of a block of code. Useful for factoring resource management, such as network or files. Also makes it possible to test management portion of the code.

#### Leah Culver (Grove creator)
* backbone.js makes it easy to add a MVC framework into JS code. (sounds like its fairly popular in the audence)

#### Laura Thompson (processing firefox crash reports)
* Sagrada, mozilla message queueing system

#### Craig Kerstiens (state of python pckg management)
* Don't distribute python packages by hosting them on your server. Does dis-use to the community. 
* Don't depend on external servers for your deployments
* Everyone should use virtualenv & pip (and audience seemed to agree)

##### Kenneth Reitz: (python for humans)
* [Slides] (https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-for-humans for slides)
* Some standard libraries are broken, e.g. urllib2, subprocess (really hard for beginners to understand)
* Created some libraries that have gotten a lot of adoption in the python community
> * Python requests - httplib for humans
> * Legit - httplib for humans

#### Avery Pennarun (python is slow only if you use it incorrectly)
* Could potentially be a good speaker for betaworks (Allan has his contact)
* Works at Google in NYC
* Bup - backup software (stores your stuff in git, backup your computer - awesome)
* Uses python to read your filessystem and back it up in git
* Line of code executes x80-100 slower
* You dont want to run a line manytimes.. you just want to interpret once and then execute that really fast in c.. interpretation takes time
* Forking is an alternative to threading (if you dont need to share memory). Consider using the multiprocessing library
* scipy - has a way of injecting C code in the python code
* Pyhon has 2 ways of managing memory:
** Refcounting - This adds overhead per operation, but does not need expensive garbage collection
** Garbage Collection - This is for the case of circular reference, where ref-counting goes awry
* Consider using weakrefs, when you dont want that reference to prevent object descruction

### <div id="demos"/>Quick Demos At the End
#### Vagrant 
* Makes it easy to create clean virtual environment running in virtualbox
* [Link](http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html)

##### Needle Test Case
* Compare the screenshots for css.. [Link](http://needle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

##### Pandas:
* Small data data analysis
* Super cool way of doing on-the-fly analysis on csv-type data. Think pivot tables. There is a web interface too.
* [Link](http://pandas.sourceforge.net/)

##### Stackful
* A way of changing the state of globals in libraries. Think of having a library using globals in that module, this enables changes the values of those globals. It feels similar to changing window.something or something.prototype in javascript.

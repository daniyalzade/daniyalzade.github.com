Practicality beats puriy
Use it where it makes sense
Approachability and at the same time maintainability

Embrace the GIL
* dis module
import dis
dis.dis(methodname)

GIL protects (imagine that there is threads running on cores simultaneously)
* Reference count updates
* Mutable types

Python interpreter is not written in a thread-safe manner. It does not use dictionalires in a threadsafe manner, and the refrence counting is not threadsafe. So you cannot run multi threads since it can be preemted

* Tight inner loop is terrible
* Line of code executes x80-100 slower
* You don't want to run a line manytimes.. you just want to interpret once and then execute that really fast in c.. interpretation takes time
* C module is cool
* In python fork using multiple cores
* scipy - puts C code in the python code
* weakrefs - does not increase the reference count
